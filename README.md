###  Technologies Used

####  🧰 Hardware 
  + Meta Motion Sensor (Wrist-Worn): Captures accelerometer and gyroscope data.

####  🧠 Software 

  - Programming Language: Python
  - Libraries:
      * Data Processing: pandas, numpy, scipy
      * Machine Learning: scikit-learn
      * Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
  - Development Tools:
  - Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and experimentation.
  - Pickle for storing and loading intermediate datasets.

##  🟢 How It Works 

####  1. Data Collection 📡
  - The dataset is collected using Meta Motion sensors worn on the wrist, mimicking the placement of a smartwatch.
  - The sensors capture accelerometer (measuring acceleration along X, Y, Z axes) and gyroscope (measuring angular velocity) data during strength training exercises.
  - Five foundational barbell exercises are recorded:
      -  Bench Press
      - Deadlift
      - Overhead Press
      - Barbell Row
      - Squat Alt Text

####  2. Data Processing 📊 
  - Outlier Removal: Detected and removed anomalies from the dataset using Local Outlier Factor (LOF).
  - Data Smoothing: Applied low-pass filtering to remove high-frequency noise and ensure smooth signals.
  - Temporal Aggregation: Summarized motion data over time windows, calculating mean, standard deviation, and other metrics.
  - Frequency Analysis: Used Fourier Transformations to identify periodic patterns, such as repetitions in exercises.

####  3. Feature Engineering 🔐 
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the dataset while retaining critical motion patterns.
  - Clustering-Based Features: Grouped similar movements using k-means clustering to distinguish between overlapping exercises.
  - Scalar Magnitudes: Combined sensor data into orientation-independent metrics to capture overall motion intensity.

####  4. Model Training 🔄
  - Machine learning models are trained to classify exercises, count repetitions, and detect improper form:
  - Classification Accuracy: Achieved 98.5% using Random Forest for exercise identification.
  - Repetition Counting: Used peak detection algorithms to count repetitions with ~95% accuracy.
  - Form Detection: Trained separate models to detect improper execution of exercises (e.g., incorrect bench press form).

####  5. Results ✨
  - Exercise Classification Accuracy: 98.5%
  - Repetition Counting Error: ~5%
  - Form Detection Accuracy: 98.5%

###  ✅ Future Directions
  -  Dataset Expansion: Include data from a broader participant base to improve model generalization.
  -  Integration with Additional Sensors: Combine data from heart rate monitors, EMG sensors, or other devices for more comprehensive insights.
  -  Real-Time Applications: Implement real-time tracking and feedback via smartwatch SDKs.
  -  Enhanced Form Detection: Expand improper form detection to include more exercises and detailed analysis.
